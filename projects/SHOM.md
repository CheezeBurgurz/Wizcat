title: 'Lotus blooms'
---

<br>At May 2019, My former work senior contacted me to design a logo for her close friend's orgnization. She wanted the logo to reflect peace and serenity, which the orgnization foster those values. I begun testing different kinds of typography with symbols to achieve the mentioned qualites. At the end, i picked lotus as a base layout to keep the design minimal. I also decided to make it line-art for two reasons, first is to experiment the look of line-art logo, and a simple line-art logo does not have a lot of details, meaning it is very flexible to use in different media format without losing it's visual quality. Personally, i like this logo for how it looks very nice on print and my senior agrees it too!
