title: 'Creating my personal logo'
---
<br>As every successful businesses require a brand identity, a mark that is instantly recognizable by a glance. It is imperative to get my own brandmark that will help boost my career prospect. It didn't take me long enough to brainstorm ideas since i already had mind on what i want in my logo. It is a black cat with a wizard hat, a character which is heavily associated with superstitious beliefs. The reasons for the idea is because cat is my favourite animal, and i am a big fan of mythical, fantasy settings.

Above image is my early mascot design. Whenever i got free time, I am studying character design principles to make my  illustrations more refined. I do plan to buy a cheap drawing tablet when Covid ends.
