title: 'Brand for my first professional workplace'
---

<br>The opportunity for the creation of my third brand design was presented when i was working at Cube Digital. The company planned to create a mobile music application for local audience and they need the brand identity first to present the project ideas to the shareholders. Before handling it to a design agency they allow me to test the designs first as they already seen a few of my previous works. I accepted it knowing it would be good for me to practice my skills in graphic design. We had a couple of meetings to pitch ideas for the brand name, and also giving feedback to the design drafts. Finally, we all agreed to pick mbeats as the brand name, which is a combination of M for Myanmar and beats(a unit concept for music). I made the design minimal and incoporate a music note to simplify our product target apparent. The color only consist mainly of black and white for a coporate look, and orange to invoke themes such as joy and happiness. The design helped negotiating with telecom operators to form a business partnership based on the service and content-provider relationship.
